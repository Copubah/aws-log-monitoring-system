# Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

The AWS Real-Time Log Monitoring and Alerting System provides automated detection and response to error patterns and security events in EC2 instance logs.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Log Collection Layer
- EC2 Instances with CloudWatch Agent
- CloudWatch Log Groups for centralized storage
- Log streams organized by instance and log type

### 2. Pattern Detection Layer
- CloudWatch Metric Filters for pattern matching
- Custom metrics for error counting
- Real-time log analysis

### 3. Alerting Layer
- CloudWatch Alarms with configurable thresholds
- SNS Topics for notification distribution
- Email subscriptions for immediate alerts

### 4. Automation Layer
- Lambda functions for automated remediation
- IAM roles with least privilege access
- Event-driven response workflows

## Data Flow

```
1. EC2 Instances generate logs
2. CloudWatch Agent collects and forwards logs
3. CloudWatch Logs receives and stores log data
4. Metric Filters analyze logs for patterns
5. Custom metrics track error occurrences
6. CloudWatch Alarms monitor metric thresholds
7. SNS publishes notifications when alarms trigger
8. Email subscribers receive immediate alerts
9. Lambda functions execute automated responses
```

## Security Architecture

### IAM Roles and Policies

#### CloudWatch Agent Role
- Permissions: CloudWatch Logs write access
- Principle: Least privilege for log collection
- Attached to: EC2 instances via instance profile

#### Lambda Execution Role
- Permissions: CloudWatch Logs, EC2 describe/control, SNS publish
- Principle: Minimal permissions for remediation tasks
- Usage: Automated incident response

### Encryption

#### At Rest
- CloudWatch Logs: Optional KMS encryption
- SNS Topics: Optional KMS encryption
- Lambda Environment: Encrypted by default

#### In Transit
- HTTPS for all AWS API calls
- TLS for CloudWatch Agent communication
- Encrypted SNS message delivery

## Monitoring Patterns

### Error Detection
- Pattern: `[timestamp, request_id, level="ERROR", ...]`
- Threshold: 5 errors in 5 minutes (configurable)
- Response: Email alert + Lambda remediation

### Failed Login Detection
- Pattern: `[timestamp, request_id, level, message="Failed login*", ...]`
- Threshold: 3 failed logins in 5 minutes (configurable)
- Response: Security alert + Enhanced monitoring

### Custom Patterns
- Extensible pattern matching system
- Support for complex log formats
- Configurable metric transformations

## Cost Optimization

### Log Retention
- Configurable retention periods (default: 7 days)
- Automatic log deletion after retention period
- Cost-effective storage management

### Resource Tagging
- Comprehensive tagging strategy
- Cost allocation and tracking
- Resource lifecycle management

### Efficient Querying
- CloudWatch Insights for log analysis
- Optimized metric filters
- Minimal data transfer costs

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### CloudWatch Agent Not Sending Logs
1. Check IAM role permissions
2. Verify agent configuration
3. Review network connectivity
4. Check agent service status

#### Alarms Not Triggering
1. Verify metric filter patterns
2. Check alarm thresholds
3. Review log data presence
4. Validate alarm configuration

#### Lambda Function Errors
1. Check execution role permissions
2. Review function logs
3. Verify SNS subscription
4. Test function independently

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check CloudWatch Agent status
sudo systemctl status amazon-cloudwatch-agent

# View agent logs
sudo tail -f /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/logs/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.log

# Test log generation
logger "ERROR: Test error message"

# Check Terraform state
terraform show

# Validate configuration
terraform validate
```
